Audit the current codebase for operator onboarding flows. I need a complete picture of what exists RIGHT NOW — not what's planned, not what's in schemas only. What can a user actually DO in the browser today.

Specifically check:

1. SIGNUP/AUTH
   - What happens when someone clicks "Sign in" or "Sign up"?
   - Is there a registration flow? What fields?
   - After signup, where does the user land?

2. OPERATOR APPLICATION/EOI
   - Is there a form or flow for a user to express interest in becoming an operator?
   - What does the "List Your First Tour" button on /for-operators link to?
   - Are there any other entry points for operators?

3. OPERATOR PROFILE CREATION
   - Can a logged-in user create an operator profile?
   - Is there a setup wizard or onboarding checklist?
   - What routes exist under /operators/ ?

4. OPERATOR DASHBOARD
   - Does /operators/[slug]/dashboard exist and render?
   - Can an operator create a tour from their dashboard?
   - What tour creation methods exist (form, chat, both)?

5. STRIPE CONNECT
   - Does /api/stripe/connect/authorize exist?
   - Is there a "Connect your Stripe account" button anywhere in the UI?
   - Can an operator complete Stripe onboarding through the app?

6. ADMIN SIDE
   - Can I create/approve operators from the admin dashboard?
   - Is there an operator approval queue?

For each item, tell me:
- EXISTS AND WORKS (route exists, renders, functional)
- EXISTS BUT BROKEN (route exists but errors/dead ends)
- ROUTE EXISTS NO UI (backend route but no frontend)
- DOES NOT EXIST

Give me file paths for everything you find.
