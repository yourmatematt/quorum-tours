## COMPETITIVE CONTEXT

### Why This Strategy Wins

**vs. Generic travel/tourism content:**
- Species-specific positioning (niche beats broad)
- Trust focus beats typical marketing hype
- Educational content has longer lifespan
- Community engagement beats broadcasting

**vs. competitor tour operators:**
- Platform positioning beats individual operator
- Operator empowerment messaging (not competition)
- Species search and quorum mechanics are genuinely novel
- Trust system is defensible differentiator

**vs. other booking platforms:**
- Depth over breadth (birding expertise, not generalist)
- Operator-first approach (not customer-first, both matter)
- Transparent mechanics (no hidden fees or pressure)
- Community as moat (not algorithm as moat)
