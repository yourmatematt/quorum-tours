# Terminology: Use "Commit" not "Express Interest"

## Rule
- **Never use "Express Interest"** for the CTA on forming tours
- **Always use "Commit"** - this matches the email flow terminology

## Correct Examples
- "Commit" (button text)
- "Commit to this tour" (page heading)
- "When you commit..." (explanation)

## Incorrect Examples (DO NOT USE)
- ~~"Express Interest"~~
- ~~"Express interest"~~
- ~~"Register Interest"~~

## Context
The welcome email uses this language:
> **Commit** — If you want this tour to run, you commit. If a deposit is required, you pay it now. The deposit is applied to your tour price later.

The CTA should match this terminology for consistency across the user journey.
