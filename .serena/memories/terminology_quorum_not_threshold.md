# Terminology: Use "Quorum" not "Threshold"

## Rule
- **Never use "threshold"** when referring to the minimum number of participants needed for a tour to run
- **Always use "quorum"** - it's the product name and core concept

## Correct Examples
- "When tour reaches quorum"
- "3 more needed to reach quorum"
- "Tour has reached quorum"
- "Quorum: 6 participants"

## Incorrect Examples (DO NOT USE)
- ~~"When tour reaches threshold"~~
- ~~"3 more needed to reach threshold"~~
- ~~"Threshold: 6 participants"~~

## Context
The product is called "Quorum Tours" - the quorum concept is central to the brand. Using "threshold" is technically accurate but misses the branding opportunity and feels generic.
