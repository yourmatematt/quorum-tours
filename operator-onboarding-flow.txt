Wire the complete operator onboarding flow end-to-end through the frontend. No mock data. No manual database inserts. Every step happens through the UI.

CONTEXT FROM CODEBASE AUDIT:
The UI exists for almost everything. The gap is backend connections. Here's what the audit found:

- /signup → WORKS
- /for-operators → WORKS (but CTA links to dead Calendly)
- /operator/profile → FORM UI COMPLETE, NO BACKEND SAVE
- /operator/tours/create → 6-STEP WIZARD COMPLETE, NO API ON PUBLISH
- /operator dashboard → EXISTS, ALL MOCK DATA
- /operator/earnings → STRIPE BUTTON EXISTS, NO CLICK HANDLER
- Stripe Connect Edge Function → EXISTS at supabase/functions/stripe-connect-onboard/index.ts
- Stripe Connect Webhook → EXISTS at supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts
- /admin → EXISTS, OPERATOR VERIFICATION QUEUE IS MOCK DATA WITH CONSOLE.LOG HANDLERS
- Admin auth gate → DOES NOT EXIST

THE FULL FLOW TO WIRE (in order of how a real operator experiences it):

STEP 1: OPERATOR APPLIES
Replace the Calendly link on /for-operators with an in-app application flow.
- "List Your First Tour" button → opens application form (new page or modal)
- Form fields: name, email, business name, location, brief description of their operation, years of experience, any relevant credentials/licenses
- On submit: create a row in an operator_applications table (or use the operators table with approval_status = 'pending')
- Send me (admin) an email notification via Resend that a new application has been received
- Show the applicant a confirmation: "Thanks — we'll review your application and be in touch within 48 hours"
- If the user is already logged in, link the application to their account. If not, prompt them to create an account as part of the flow.

STEP 2: ADMIN REVIEWS AND APPROVES
Wire the existing admin verification queue at /admin:
- Fetch real pending applications from Supabase (replace mock data in OperatorVerificationQueue.tsx)
- Display applicant details
- "Approve" button: update approval_status to 'approved', create the operator record if needed, set linked_operator_id on their profile, send approval email to operator via Resend
- "Reject" button: update status to 'rejected', send rejection email
- Protect /admin routes with middleware — only my account (check for admin role or a specific user ID) can access

STEP 3: OPERATOR LOGS IN AND SEES DASHBOARD
When an approved operator logs in:
- Middleware or layout check: if user has linked_operator_id, show operator nav/dashboard access
- /operator loads real data from their operator record, not mock data
- If they have no tours yet, show empty state with clear "Create Your First Tour" CTA
- Wire ALL dashboard pages to real Supabase queries scoped to their operator_id:
  - /operator → real metrics (tour count, booking count, total earnings — zeros are fine)
  - /operator/tours → real tours list (empty state initially)
  - /operator/bookings → real bookings via their tours (empty state initially)
  - /operator/earnings → real earnings (empty state initially)

STEP 4: OPERATOR COMPLETES PROFILE
/operator/profile form already exists. Wire it:
- On load: fetch their operator record, populate all form fields
- On save: UPDATE the operator record in Supabase
- Persist everything the form collects: name, tagline, bio, location, photo, credentials
- Success/error toast feedback
- Profile data flows through to public page at /operators/[id]

STEP 5: OPERATOR CREATES FIRST TOUR
/operator/tours/create wizard already exists (6 steps). Wire the publish step:
- On publish: INSERT into tours table with their operator_id
- Map all wizard fields to the tours table schema
- After successful publish: redirect to /operator/tours showing their new tour
- Tour must appear on the public /tours page
- Tour must appear on their public operator profile

STEP 6: STRIPE CONNECT
Wire the existing button in EarningsView.tsx:
- Button click → call the existing Edge Function at supabase/functions/stripe-connect-onboard
- Edge Function already creates a Connect account and returns an onboarding URL
- Redirect operator to Stripe's hosted onboarding flow
- On return from Stripe: land on /operator/earnings with updated status
- The webhook at supabase/functions/stripe-webhook already handles account.updated — make sure it updates the operator record's stripe fields
- Show connection status on the earnings page: Not Connected / Pending / Active

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:
I visit /for-operators → click apply → fill form → submit.
I go to /admin → see the application → click approve.
The operator gets an email → logs in → sees their dashboard.
They edit their profile → it saves and shows on the public site.
They create a tour → it publishes and appears on /tours.
They connect Stripe → redirected to Stripe → come back connected.

The entire flow works through the browser. No database console. No manual inserts. No mock data anywhere in the operator experience.

PRIORITY ORDER IF YOU NEED TO SHIP INCREMENTALLY:
1. Operator application form (replaces Calendly dead link)
2. Admin approval wiring (replaces mock queue)
3. Profile save (operator's first action after approval)
4. Tour publish (the whole point)
5. Dashboard real data (confirms their tour exists)
6. Stripe Connect wiring (needed before anyone pays, not before tonight)
