**What happens if you pay on time:**
- Your balance is charged.
- Your booking is confirmed.
- You'll receive tour details (meeting point, what to bring, operator contact) within 48 hours.
- You're all set.

**What happens if you miss the deadline:**
- Your deposit is forfeited to the operator (minus 3% platform fee).
- Your spot goes to the next person on the waitlist.
- You receive a strike on your account.
- Strikes are permanent but can be appealed through support if extenuating circumstances apply.

This is not negotiable. The 24-hour window exists because operators need certainty. If everyone who commits paid when it's convenient, tours would fall apart.
