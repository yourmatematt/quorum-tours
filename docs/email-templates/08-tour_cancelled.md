We understand this is disappointing. Quorum-based booking works best when operators have a solid waiting list and birders know the tours will happen. Sometimes the timing just doesn't align.

If you have feedback on what would've made you commit to this tour, reach out. We read every message and use it to improve.

Best,
The Quorum Team

P.S. If the operator wants to try again with adjusted dates or pricing, they'll reach out directly. You'll be first to know.
