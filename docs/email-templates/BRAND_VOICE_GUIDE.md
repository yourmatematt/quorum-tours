# Quorum Tours Email Brand Voice Guide

This guide ensures all transactional emails maintain consistent brand voice and personality—even as different writers contribute to the templates.

---

## Core Voice Pillars

### 1. Clarity First, Persuasion Never

**What this means:**
- No manipulation through scarcity, urgency, or social proof
- No vague language that requires interpretation
- State facts directly, numbers specifically

**Examples:**

| ✗ Don't | ✓ Do |
|---------|------|
| "Limited spots available" | "4 spots remaining" |
| "Soon" | "March 10, 2026 at 2:15 PM" |
| "Amazing birding experience" | "Spring Warblers at Oak Ridge" |
| "Act now to secure your spot" | "You have 24 hours to pay" |
| "Unlock exclusive tours" | "Browse available tours" |
| "This is time-sensitive" | "Deadline: March 10 at 2:15 PM" |

---

### 2. Institutional Trust Over Brand Personality

**What this means:**
- Write like a trusted institution (university, museum, gov agency)
- Not like a startup trying to be your friend
- Warm but professional, never casual or trendy
- Use "The Quorum Team" (not "The squad" or "We're stoked")

**Tone examples:**

| ✗ Casual/Trendy | ✓ Institutional |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "Yo, your tour is confirmed!" | "Your booking is confirmed." |
| "We're stoked you're joining!" | "Looking forward to seeing you there." |
| "Don't ghost us" | "No last-minute cancellations. Everyone committed, everyone shows up." |
| "Get birding ASAP" | "You'll receive tour details within 48 hours." |

**Word choices:**
- Use formal second person: "You have 24 hours" not "You've got 24 hours"
- Use present tense for facts: "The tour is confirmed" not "The tour's confirmed"
- Use full words: "Cannot book" not "Can't book" (more formal)
- Avoid contractions in critical messaging (deposits, deadlines, consequences)

---

### 3. Honest About Friction, Not Apologic

**What this means:**
- State constraints, deadlines, and consequences clearly
- Don't soften or hide the hard parts
- Explain the "why" behind friction (it serves a real purpose)
- Never apologize for the system's design

**Examples:**

| ✗ Apologic | ✓ Honest |
|-----------|---------|
| "We regret to inform you..." | "You did not pay within the deadline." |
| "Unfortunately, the deposit requirement exists..." | "Deposits create accountability. When you commit and don't follow through, the deposit compensates the operator for the disruption." |
| "We understand this may feel strict..." | "This is not negotiable. Operators need certainty." |
| "Sorry, but the 24-hour window is firm" | "The 24-hour window exists because operators need certainty." |

---

### 4. Specific Over Generic

**What this means:**
- Include concrete details: dates, amounts, names, locations
- Never write template-like sentences that could apply to any tour
- Reference actual system mechanics (deposits, strikes, quorum)
- Use data from the specific booking/tour

**Examples:**

| ✗ Generic | ✓ Specific |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Your tour is coming up soon" | "Spring Warblers at Oak Ridge on March 15, 2026" |
| "You'll receive a notification" | "You'll receive tour details (meeting point, what to bring, operator contact) within 48 hours" |
| "A spot is available" | "A spot has opened up on Spring Warblers at Oak Ridge on March 15, 2026" |
| "Your deposit will be processed" | "Your deposit ($25.00, minus 3% platform fee = $24.25) goes to the operator" |

---

### 5. Explicit Confirmation Mechanics

**What this means:**
- Always confirm what just happened
- Explain what happens next
- State consequences and timelines
- Remove ambiguity about conditional vs. certain commitments

**Email structure example:**
```
Hi [NAME],

[STATE WHAT JUST HAPPENED in one sentence]

[EXPLAIN WHAT THIS MEANS in 1-2 paragraphs]

[WHAT HAPPENS NEXT with timeline]

[WHAT YOU NEED TO DO with deadline]

[SUPPORT/QUESTIONS path]
```

---

## Prohibited Language

These words/phrases conflict with Quorum's anti-marketing brand. **Never use:**

### Vague Promise Words
- "seamless" — What does this mean exactly?
- "unlock" — Sounds like you're hiding features
- "journey" — This is a transactional email, not storytelling
- "elevate" — Manipulative, promises too much
- "empower" — Vague and corporate
- "robust" — Nobody knows what this means
- "comprehensive" — Too generic
- "solutions" — This is a booking, not a solution

### Artificial Urgency
- "Act now"
- "Don't miss out"
- "Limited time"
- "Exclusive access"
- "Last chance"
- "Only [X] left"
- "Hurry"

### Social Proof/FOMO
- "Join thousands of birders"
- "See what others are discovering"
- "Popular tour"
- "[X]% of users who book"
- Testimonials in transactional emails
- Star ratings

### Emotional Manipulation
- "We're disappointed if you don't pay"
- "Help us keep the platform alive"
- "Your support means everything"
- "We believe in you"
- "Let's make this happen"

### Vague Benefits
- "Better birding"
- "Unforgettable experiences"
- "Bird lovers like you"
- "Your perfect tour"
- "Passion for nature"

## What to Use Instead

### For Time-Sensitivity (without artificial urgency)
| ✗ | ✓ |
|----|---|
| "Act now!" | "You have 24 hours to pay" |
| "Spots going fast" | "4 spots remaining" |
| "Don't wait" | "Deadline: March 10, 2026 at 2:15 PM" |

### For Benefits (be specific)
| ✗ | ✓ |
|----|---|
| "Unlock exclusive tours" | "Browse available tours with verified guides" |
| "Better birding" | "Spring Warblers at Oak Ridge, led by [Operator Name], March 15" |
| "Premium experience" | "Guaranteed group size (quorum-confirmed)" |

### For Commitment (be clear)
| ✗ | ✓ |
|----|---|
| "Join us" | "Commit to [TOUR_NAME]" |
| "Embark on" | "Participate in" |
| "Become part of" | "Join [OPERATOR_NAME]'s tour" |

---

## Tone in Different Contexts

### Deposits & Trust System (Be Clear, Not Scary)

❌ **Scary:**
> "WARNING: If you don't pay, you'll be penalized and banned!"

✓ **Clear but honest:**
> "If you miss the 24-hour payment window, your deposit goes to the operator and you receive a strike. Strikes are permanent but can be appealed if extenuating circumstances apply."

**Principles:**
- State the consequence directly
- Explain the reason (operator protection, system fairness)
- Acknowledge appeal process (accountability works both ways)
- No shame language ("We're disappointed in you")

---

### Missed Deadlines (Be Direct, Not Punitive)

❌ **Punitive:**
> "You failed to meet your obligation. Your account is now flagged as unreliable."

✓ **Direct:**
> "You did not pay for [TOUR_NAME] within the 24-hour deadline. Your deposit ([AMOUNT]) has been forfeited to the operator, and you've received a strike on your account."

**Principles:**
- State the fact (you didn't pay)
- State the consequence (deposit forfeited, strike applied)
- State the impact (what changes for future bookings)
- Offer a path forward (appeal process)

---

### Celebrations (Be Warm, Not Over-the-Top)

❌ **Over-the-top:**
> "AMAZING! Your tour is CONFIRMED! You're going to have the BEST DAY EVER!"

✓ **Warm but professional:**
> "Your booking is confirmed. Looking forward to seeing you there."

**Principles:**
- Acknowledge the positive outcome (confirmation)
- Keep it professional (not hype)
- Focus on next steps (practical details)
- Warm sign-off (appropriate to relationship)

---

## Matching Tone to Email Type

### Confirmatory Emails (welcome, tour_committed, payment_confirmed)
- **Tone:** Clear, helpful, warm
- **Goal:** User understands what's happening and feels secure
- **Structure:** What just happened → What this means → What's next
- **Temperature:** Warm but professional

### Urgent Deadline Emails (quorum_reached, payment_reminder)
- **Tone:** Direct, factual, no soft-pedaling
- **Goal:** User takes action before deadline
- **Structure:** The deadline → Why it matters → How to comply → Consequences if not
- **Temperature:** Professional, matter-of-fact

### Consequence Emails (strike_applied, deposit_forfeited)
- **Tone:** Direct, explanatory, fair but firm
- **Goal:** User understands why this happened and what it means
- **Structure:** What happened → Why it happened → What changes → Appeal path
- **Temperature:** Professional, not punitive

### Informational Emails (new_booking, tour_cancelled, tour_reminder)
- **Tone:** Helpful, clear, action-focused
- **Goal:** Recipient knows exactly what's happening and what to do
- **Structure:** The situation → The details → Any action needed → Support path
- **Temperature:** Warm, accessible

### Celebratory Emails (payout_sent)
- **Tone:** Grateful, warm, encouraging
- **Goal:** Operator feels valued and motivated to create more tours
- **Structure:** The news → The details → Recognition of effort → Encouragement to continue
- **Temperature:** Warm, genuine

---

## Consistency Across Emails

### Terminology
Use these exact terms consistently:
- "Deposit" (not "security deposit," "down payment," "commitment fee")
- "Quorum" (not "minimum," "threshold," "target")
- "Commitment" (not "booking," "registration," "enrollment")
- "Strike" (not "mark," "flag," "violation")
- "Tour confirms" (not "tour locked in," "tour secured")
- "Tour didn't reach quorum" (not "tour was cancelled," "tour didn't make it")

### Formatting
- Dates: "Month DD, YYYY" (e.g., "March 15, 2026")
- Times: "H:MM AM/PM" (e.g., "2:15 PM")
- Currency: "$XXX.XX" (e.g., "$189.00")
- Numbers: Use numerals (4, not four)
- Emphasis: Bold for key info, never ALL CAPS

### Structure
Most emails follow this pattern:
1. Greeting (personalized)
2. Main news (state what just happened)
3. Explanation (what it means and why)
4. Next steps (what the user/operator does)
5. Deadline/timeline (when relevant)
6. Call to action (specific link or action)
7. Clarification or common FAQ (addressing confusion)
8. Support path (how to get help)
9. Sign-off ("Best, The Quorum Team")

---

## Personalization Strategy

### What to Personalize
- First name (Hi [NAME])
- Tour name (specifically identifying their tour)
- Specific amounts and dates (their booking details)
- Direct operator name (for communications about their tour)

### What NOT to Personalize
- Overly familiar language ("Hey [NAME]!")
- Assumptions about emotional state ("We know you're excited!")
- Relationship claims ("We're like family")
- Preferences without data ("Since you love warblers...")

### Voice Rule
Even with personalization, maintain institutional tone. It's okay to personalize data, not personality.

**Good:**
> "Hi Alice, your commitment to Spring Warblers at Oak Ridge is confirmed."

**Bad:**
> "Hey Alice! How awesome that you're joining this amazing tour!"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Too Much Marketing Language
**Wrong:** "Unlock exclusive birding experiences. Seamless booking for nature lovers like you."
**Right:** "Browse available tours led by verified guides."

### Mistake 2: Hiding Bad News
**Wrong:** "Your account will require enhanced booking requirements."
**Right:** "You've received a strike. On your next booking, the operator can require a deposit."

### Mistake 3: Over-Softening Deadlines
**Wrong:** "We kindly ask that you complete your payment as soon as possible."
**Right:** "You have 24 hours to pay: [DEADLINE_DATETIME]."

### Mistake 4: Inconsistent Tone Across Sentences
**Wrong:** "Your tour is secured! Please ensure you review the logistics info. Yo, you're about to have an amazing experience!"
**Right:** "Your booking is confirmed. Review the tour details below. Looking forward to seeing you there."

### Mistake 5: Generic Template Language
**Wrong:** "A spot is available on an exciting birding adventure!"
**Right:** "A spot has opened up on Spring Warblers at Oak Ridge on March 15, 2026."

---

## Accessibility & Inclusivity

### Language Choices
- Avoid "crazy good" (ableist)
- Avoid "deaf to concerns" (ableist)
- Avoid "blind spot" (ableist)
- Avoid gendered pronouns (use "they" or repeat name)
- Avoid cultural assumptions ("holiday," "summer," etc.)

### Inclusive Descriptions
- When describing tours or birding: Be specific about difficulty, accessibility
- Don't assume age, ability, experience level
- Use active voice and clear grammar (helps people with reading disabilities)

---

## Sign-Off & Closing Lines

### Standard Sign-Off
```
Best,
The Quorum Team
```

### Optional P.S. (Use Sparingly)
Only use if there's something helpful/practical:
- "P.S. Leave early on the day of your tour. Parking often takes longer than expected."
- "P.S. If the operator wants to try again with adjusted dates, they'll reach out directly."

### NEVER:
- Don't use "Warmly," "Cheers," "Thrilled," or other try-hard closings
- Don't add a line like "Let's keep birding!" or "Happy birding!" (too casual)
- Don't include company taglines or mission statements
- Don't add marketing footer copy
