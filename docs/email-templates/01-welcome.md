## Email Body

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Welcome to Quorum Tours.

Our platform works differently than traditional tour booking. Instead of paying upfront, you signal interest first, commit conditionally if enough people want the tour, and only pay when the tour is guaranteed to run.

**Here's the flow:**

1. **Browse tours** — Each tour shows its quorum (minimum participants needed) and how many people have committed.

2. **Commit** — If you want this tour to run, you commit. If a deposit is required, you pay it now. The deposit is applied to your tour price later.

3. **Wait for quorum** — Other people commit too. If enough of you commit, the tour reaches quorum.

4. **Tour confirms** — Once quorum is reached, the tour is guaranteed to run. You have 24 hours to pay the balance.

5. **You go birding** — Everyone who paid joins the tour.

**About deposits**

As a new user, you'll pay a deposit when you commit to a tour. The deposit amount is set by the tour operator and is applied to your tour price—it's not an extra fee. You pay it upfront when you commit.

Why deposits? Tours only work when people show up. If you commit to a tour and quorum is reached, you've taken a spot. If you then don't pay the balance, you disrupt the operator and other birders who were counting on you. The deposit compensates them for that disruption.

If you pay on time, your deposit applies to what you owe. If you miss the 24-hour payment deadline after the tour confirms, you lose the deposit and receive a strike on your account.

**What happens if a tour doesn't reach quorum?**

Your deposit is refunded in full. No strikes, no impact.

Looking forward to getting you birding.

Best,
The Quorum Team
