Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 6 February 2026
Quorum Tours is operated by Your Mate Agency ABN 37179872328 ("we", "us", "our", or "Quorum Tours"). We are committed to protecting your personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information through our website at quorumtours.com and related services (the "Platform").
Quorum Tours operates as a marketplace connecting wildlife tour customers ("Customers") with independent tour operators ("Operators"). We act as an agent facilitating bookings, not as the provider of tour services.

Publicly available birding data from platforms such as eBird (only when voluntarily linked by you)

2. How We Use Your Information
We use your personal information for the following purposes:

To create and manage your account on the Platform
To facilitate tour bookings between Customers and Operators, including threshold-based tour confirmation
To process payments via Stripe Connect (Direct Charges model — funds flow directly from Customer to Operator)
To match you with relevant tours based on your species chase list and preferences
To send booking confirmations, tour updates, threshold progress notifications, and pre-trip communications
To send marketing communications where you have opted in (you may unsubscribe at any time)
To improve the Platform, analyse usage patterns, and develop new features
To comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our Terms of Service

3. How We Share Your Information
3.1 With Operators
When you book a tour, we share relevant booking details with the Operator, including your name, contact details, experience level, dietary requirements, and any information necessary for the safe conduct of the tour. Operators are independent businesses and are responsible for their own privacy practices.
3.2 With Service Providers

Stripe — payment processing (Stripe's privacy policy applies to payment data)
Vercel — website hosting
Supabase — database and authentication services
Resend — transactional email delivery

3.3 As Required by Law
We may disclose personal information where required by Australian law, regulation, or court order, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Quorum Tours, our users, or the public.
3.4 Business Transfers
In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your personal information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such change.
4. Data Storage and Security
Your data is stored on servers operated by Supabase (cloud infrastructure). We implement industry-standard security measures including:

Encryption of data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest
Row-level security policies in our database
Secure authentication with hashed passwords
Regular security reviews of our codebase and infrastructure

No method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
5. Your Rights Under the Australian Privacy Principles
You have the right to:

Access the personal information we hold about you
Request correction of inaccurate, incomplete, or out-of-date information
Request deletion of your account and associated data (subject to legal retention requirements)
Opt out of marketing communications at any time
Lodge a complaint with us or with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) if you believe your privacy has been breached

To exercise any of these rights, contact us at hello@quorumtours.com.
6. Data Retention
We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services. After account deletion, we may retain certain data for up to 7 years where required for legal, tax, or dispute resolution purposes. Anonymised and aggregated data (such as platform usage statistics) may be retained indefinitely.
7. Cookies and Tracking
We use essential cookies to maintain your session and preferences. We may also use analytics cookies (such as those provided by Vercel Analytics) to understand how the Platform is used. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings. The Platform does not respond to "Do Not Track" browser signals at this time.
8. Children's Privacy
The Platform is not directed at children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will take steps to delete it promptly.
9. International Data Transfers
Some of our service providers (Stripe, Vercel, Supabase) may process data outside Australia, including in the United States. Where this occurs, we take reasonable steps to ensure your information is treated in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles.
10. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated policy on our website, updating the effective date, and where appropriate, sending you an email notification. Continued use of the Platform after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
